Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash.
â€¢ In interactive mode:
	ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.
	ctrl-D exits the shell.
	ctrl-\ does nothing.

ctrl-c	-> SIGINT
ctrl-\	-> SIGQUIT
ctr-d	-> is not a signal. Represents EOF.

Initializes sigaction struct new_action:

-	Inits mask to empty by calling sigemptyset
-	Inits flags to 0
-	Sets restorer to NULL (didn't read up on this one tbh)
Sets newaction to handle SIGINT.
Calls sigaction to set behavior for each signal to the actions
specified in new_action.

correct this way and doesn't have to void sig.

-	need to put \n to make the prompt reappear on the next line
