- Check exit codes
- clean up env
Dangers (problenms I found others had in their evals):
	- leak with exit (well not problem for us so far, but lets think about it together)
	- a problem with cd. when PWD is unset and segfault with multiple variables

    - OLDPWD is not updated after a cd call
    ðŸ™ƒ
		- same as above, i think its handled, but pls take a look if u can break it
		- also: if we unset pwd, our minishell will still successfully execute "pwd" because it doesnt need the env variable
- cat ctrl+ c duplicates prompt. Net chorosho
- leak after running minishell - cat -ctrl+c - ctrl+d
